# Angular JS

A great way to get introduced to AngularJS is to work through ```PhoneCat``` tutorial, which walks you through the construction of an AngularJS web app

The app you will build is a catalog that,

1. Displays a list of Android devices
2. Lets you filter the list to see only devices that interest you
3. View details for any device

## Environment Setup

Clone the angular-phonecat repository located at GitHub by running the following command:
```
git clone --depth=16 https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat.git
```

Change your current directory to ```angular-phonecat```
```
cd angular-phonecat
```

### Node.js

Check the version of Node.js that you have installed by running the following command:

```
node --version
```

Or, you can download a Node.js installer for your operating system from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
